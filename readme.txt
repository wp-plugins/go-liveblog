A liveblogging engine for WordPress.

== Description ==

GigaOM built this plugin during a 1-day hackathon on August 7, 2012 as a collaborative team building excercise.  The goal was to produce a fully functional, scalable solution that could be used for future events that should be live-blogged.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `go-liveblog` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Place `[go_liveblog start_date="YYYY-mm-dd H:i:s" end_date="YYYY-mm-dd H:i:s"]` in a post or page.  ex. [go_liveblog start_date="2012-08-01 09:00:00" end_date="2012-08-31 11:30:00"]
